# Psychic-Game

A browser-based JavaScript game where the player has to guess the letter in the English alphabet selected by the computer.

## Project Motivation

This game was developed as part of an introductory JavaScript homework assignment at the University of Toronto Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. This project is a testament to the mastery of fundamental JavaScript concepts (variables, conditionals, loops, objects, functions and many more) that resulted in a game that is simple yet powerful and fun to play. It also goes to show how simple programming concepts can be coupled together to create a great product.

## Getting Started

Either download the zipped project from GitHub or clone the repo into your local machine and open index.html using a browser. When the page loads up, the game will start and you start making guesses!

## Getting Help
